# Background and Objectives

In this quest, we're stepping into the wizarding world of Harry Potter to tackle a particularly tedious problem. Harry has gotten into trouble again with Dolores Umbridge and has been sentenced to write out 200 lines of "I must not tell lies". As developers, our task is to streamline this process and alleviate Harry's toil.

Currently, the application uses a "load more" button to display an additional set of lines. This approach requires user interaction and slows down the writing process, something we aim to rectify.

Our objective is to implement an infinite scroll feature, which would automatically load more lines as Harry scrolls down the page, making the writing process smoother and faster. We will be harnessing the power of the Intersection Observer API with a Stimulus controller to achieve this result. This way, the 'load more lines' link will be triggered when it comes into the viewport, dynamically loading the next 10 lines.

Through this quest, you will familiarize yourself with the setup of Stimulus controllers in Rails, learn about the use cases of Intersection Observers, and understand how you can integrate the Intersection Observer API with Stimulus controllers to create dynamic behavior in Rails.

## Key Learning Points:
- How do you set up stimulus controllers in Rails?
- What are the use cases of Intersection Observers?
- How can you integrate the Intersection Observer API with Stimulus controllers to create dynamic behaviour in Rails?
